                <p>
                    Strong Capitals (hereinafter the “Company”) is required to categorize its Clients into one of the
                    following three categories: retail, professional or eligible counter-party.<br>
                    I. CLIENT CLASSIFICATION<br>
                    The Company, prior to engaging in business relationship with its potential clients, notifies the
                    potential clients of the clients’ classification in use by the Company, and informs them about the
                    category in which they are initially classified by the Company. Clients shall be categorized as follows,
                    based on the criteria outlined below:<br>
                    <strong>a. Professional Clients</strong>
                    <br>Professional client is a client who possesses the experience, knowledge and expertise to make its
                    own investment decisions and properly assess the risks that it incurs.<br>
                    In order to be considered a professional client, the client must fall within the following categories of
                    clients:<br>
                    i. Entities which are required to be authorized or regulated to operate in the financial market, such
                    as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Credit institutions</li>
                    <li> Investment Firms</li>
                    <li> Other authorized or regulated financial institutions</li>
                    <li> Insurance undertakings</li>
                    <li> Collective investment schemes and management companies of such schemes</li>
                    <li> Pension funds and management companies of such funds</li>
                    <li> Commodity and commodity derivatives dealers</li>
                    <li> Locals</li>
                    <li> Other institutional investors</li>

                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>Large undertakings meeting two of the following size requirements, on a proportional basis:</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li> Balance Sheet total at least</li>
                    <li> Net Turnover at least</li>
                    <li> Own Funds at least</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    iii. National and regional governments and public bodies<br>
                    iv. Other institutional investor whose main activity is to invest in financial instruments including
                    entities dedicated to the securitization of assets or other financing transactions<br>
                    <strong>b. Retail Clients</strong><br>
                    Each client, who is not a professional client, is considered to be a retail client.<br>
                    II. OPTION TO CHANGE CLASSIFICATION<br>
                    It is noted that an eligible counterparty or professional client is allowed to request non professional
                    treatment and the Company may agree to provide a higher level of protection. In this respect, the
                    Company notifies its clients in a written form of their option to be classified as retail clients. The
                    Company proceeds in this action, in order to offer a uniform level of protection to all of its
                    clients.<br>
                    The higher level of protection will be provided by the Company when the client enters into a written
                    agreement with the Company, to the effect that it shall not be treated as a professional. It is the
                    responsibility of the client who is classified as a professional client to ask for a higher level of
                    protection when he is not in a position to properly assess and manage the risks involved in the
                    transactions.<br>
                    In addition, clients who have been initially classified by the Company as retail clients are allowed to
                    request to be treated as professional clients, provided that at least two of the following criteria are
                    satisfied:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The client has carried out transactions, in significant size, at an average frequency of 10 per
                        quarter over the previous ten quarters.</li>
                    <li>The size of the client’s financial instrument portfolio exceeds EUR500.000.</li>
                    <li>The client works or has worked in the financial sector for at least one year in a professional
                        position, which requires knowledge of the transactions or services envisaged.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    III. REQUEST FOR DIFFERENT CATEGORISATION<br>
                    In accordance with Section II above, the following request may be submitted to the company:<br>
                    a) A Retail Client requesting to be categorised as a Professional Client. In that case the Client will
                    be afforded a lower level of protection.<br>
                    b) A Professional Client requesting to be categorised as a Retail Client. In that case the Client seeks
                    to obtain a higher level of protection.<br>
                    The Company reserves the right to decline any of the above requests for different categorisation.<br>
                    IV. PROTECTION RIGHTS
                    <br>Retail Clients/ Professional Clients<br>
                    Where the Company treats the Client as a retail client, he/she/they will be entitled to more protections
                    under the law than if the Client was entitled to be a professional client. In summary the additional
                    protections retail clients are entitled to are as follows:<br>
                    a) A retail client will be given more information/disclosures with regard to the Company, its services
                    and any investments, its cost, commissions, fees and charges and the safeguarding of client financial
                    instruments and client funds.<br>
                    b) When executing orders, the Company must take all reasonable steps to achieve what is called “best
                    execution” of the client’s orders that is to obtain the best possible result for their clients.<br>
                    Where the Company executes an order on behalf of a retail client, the best possible result shall be
                    determined in terms of the total consideration, representing the price of the financial instrument and
                    the cost related to execution, which shall include all expenses incurred by the client which are
                    directly related to the execution of the order, including execution venue fees, clearing and settlement
                    fees and any other fees paid to the third parties involved in the execution of the order.<br>
                    When providing professional clients with best execution the Company in not required prioritise the
                    overall cost of the transaction as being the most important factor in achieving best execution for
                    them.<br>
                    c) The Company must inform retail clients of material difficulties relevant to the proper carrying out

                    regulation (hereinafter, the called the “AML Act”)<br>
                    d. The Company shall take all reasonable measures to ensure that accounts are not used for the purpose
                    of holding assets obtained as the result of, or for facilitating the commission of any criminal activity

                    e. The Company shall develop and implement policies and procedures to identify and avoid money
                    laundering transactions and to ensure compliance with the requirements of any relevant Asic legislation;

                    f. The Company shall, on a regular basis, evaluate the effectiveness of their policies and control
                    procedures in complying with the legislative requirements and any relevant guidelines, and such

                    The Company shall establish procedures to obtain appropriate evidence of client identity, and shall
                    maintain adequate records of client identity and transactions involved in such a manner as to assist, if

                    <strong>A. The role of the Board</strong>
                    <br>a. The Board has the ultimately responsibility for the effectiveness of the Company’s AML framework.
                    The Board’s oversight role is intended to ensure, inter alia, that there is compliance with all the
                    relevant laws and regulations and international standards. Such compliance should assist in the
                    detection of suspicious transactions and permit the creation of an audit trail if an investigation is
                    deemed necessary.<br>
                    b. The Board and the Senior Management should be aware that:<br>
                    <em>a. The use of a group-wide policy does not absolve directors of their responsibility to ensure that
                        the policy is appropriate for the Company and compliant with Australia law, regulations and
                        guidelines. Failure to ensure compliance by the Company with the requirements of the AML Act may
                        result in significant penalties for directors and the financial institution.</em>
                    <br>
                    <em>b. Subsidiaries and branches of the Company, if applicable, including those domiciled outside of
                        Australia are expected to, at a minimum, comply with the requirements of the AML Act and the AML
                        Guidelines; and</em><br>
                    <em>c. Where some of the Company’s operational functions are outsourced of Australia are expected to, at
                        a minimum, comply with the requirements of the AML Act and </em>
                    <strong>AML Guidelines.</strong> <br>
                    <br>c. The Board should therefore demonstrate its commitment to an effective AML programme by:<br>
                    <em>a. Understanding the statutory duties placed upon it, their staff and the entity it
                        represents;</em><br>
                    <em>b. Approving AML policies and procedures that are appropriate for the risks faced by the Company.
                        Evidence of consideration and approval of these policies should be reflected in the board minutes
                        and noted in the policy;</em>
                    <br>
                    <em>c. Appointing an individual within the organization to ensure that the Company’s AML procedures are
                        being managed effectively; and</em><br>
                    <em>d. Seeking assurance that the Company is in compliance with its statutory responsibilities as it
                        relates to AML. This includes reviewing the reports from compliance on the operations and
                        effectiveness of compliance systems.</em>

                        pattern of financial transactions and commitments, should be formally documented and, at a minimum,

                        <strong>Recognition and reporting of suspicious transactions</strong><br>
                        i. The Company shall promptly report suspicious transactions relating to any account to the
                        Supervisory Authority. <br>
                        ii. The Company shall pay special attention to all complex, unusual or large business transactions,
                        or unusual patterns of transactions whether completed or not, and to insignificant but periodic
                        transactions, which have no apparent economic or lawful purpose.<br>
                        iii. Upon reasonable suspicion that the transactions described in paragraph (ii) above could
                        constitute or be related to money laundering, or other criminal activities, the Company shall
                        promptly report the suspicious transactions to the Supervisory Authority.<br>
                        iv. The Company shall not notify any person, other than a court, competent authority or other person
                        authorised by law, that information has been requested by or furnished to a court or the Supervisory
                        Authority.<br>
                        v. Where a report referred to in paragraph (iii) above is made in good faith, the Company and its
                        employees, staff, directors, owners or other representatives as authorised by law, shall be exempted
                        from criminal, civil or administrative liability, as the case may be, for complying with this

                        any legislative, regulatory or administrative provision, regardless of the result of the

                        vi. Where there is suspicion that the source of funds may be criminal or that a client may be
                        involved in criminal activity, the Company shall follow established procedures for assessing the
                        evidence and determining what course of action should be pursued.<br>

                        the business relationship or whether they should subject it to particular scrutiny or undertake
                        further investigation, and consideration shall be given to whether or not it is appropriate to make
                        a report to the Supervisory Authority.<br>
                        viii. The Company shall make a report in any case in which he knows that funds are connected with

                        applied to determine what constitutes a suspicious transaction but an understanding of the client’s
                        business and adequate record keeping shall facilitate the assessment.<br>
                        x. For the purpose of clarification, unsatisfactory explanation or lack of commercial rationale,
                        unusual patterns of transactions and inconsistency with the client’s business may be indicia that a
                        transaction or a series of transactions should be subjected to particular scrutiny.<br>
                        xi. The Company shall have internal procedures to ensure that suspicions about the source of funds
                        or transactions are reported to the Supervisory Authority and they shall be aware of the importance
                        of cooperation with the Supervisory Authority and the Commission.<br>

                        Supervisory Authority.<br>

                        be aware of the dangers of impeding an investigation into money laundering or other criminal
                        activity by tipping off the client or others.<br>
                        xiv. The Company shall cooperate fully with law enforcement authorities and the Commission to ensure
                        that money laundering or other criminal activities are fully investigated and prosecuted.<br>

                        facilitate criminal activities, he shall withhold the performance of such services.<br>

                        There are two main constituents of a person’s identity, which for the purposes of these Guidelines
                        are the physical identity (e.g. name and date of birth) and the activity undertaken.<br>
                        ix. The Company must avoid the acceptance of anonymous accounts or accounts in fictitious names.<br>
                        x. As part of the due diligence process, a financial institution should:<br>
                        a. Use reasonable measures to verify and adequately document the identity of the customer or account

                        outset of the relationship.<br>
                        b. Employ enhanced due diligence procedures for high risk customers or transactions or business
                        relationships such as private banking operations, non-resident customers, trust arrangements,
                        companies having nominee shareholders or customers who the financial institution has reasons to
                        believe are being refused banking facilities by another financial institution<br>
                        xi. The following original documents are acceptable methods for confirmation of the identity of
                        local customers:<br>

                        v. Where prospective customers provide documents with which a financial institution is unfamiliar,
                        either because of origin, format or language, the financial institution must take reasonable steps
                        to verify that the document is indeed authentic, which may include contacting the relevant
                        authorities or obtaining a notarized translation.<br>
                        vi. In circumstances where the Company’s customer is considered a high risk client, the Company

                        vii. Where a customer is unable to produce original documentation needed for identification or
                        verification, copies should be accepted if certified by persons listed in section 11.5 of this

                        incorporated abroad but registered under the Companies Act;<br>
                        g. Satisfactory evidence of the identity of all account signatories, details of their relationship
                        with the company and if they are not employees, an explanation of the relationship. All signatories
                        must be verified in accordance with the identification and verification of identity requirements of
                        natural persons;<br>
                        h. Identity information on the natural persons with a controlling interest in the corporate entity.
                        This information should extend, as far as practicable, to identifying those with a minimum of 10%
                        shareholding, those who ultimately own and have principal control over the company’s assets,
                        including anyone who is giving instructions to the financial institution to act on behalf of the
                        company. However, if the company is publicly listed on a recognized stock exchange and not subject
                        to effective control by a small group of individuals, identification and verification of the
                        identity of shareholders is not required;<br>
                        i. Confirmation before a business relationship is established, by way of company search and/or other
                        commercial enquiries that the applicant company has not been, or is not in the process of being
                        dissolved, struck off the companies register, wound-up or terminated. Such confirmation may be
                        verified by obtaining a current Certificate of Good Standing or equivalent document or
                        alternatively, obtaining a set of consolidated financial statements that have been audited by a
                        reliable firm of auditors and that show the group structure and ultimate controlling party;<br>
                        ii. Therefore, the Company obtains the following information and documents when seeking to verify
                        the identity of corporate customers:<br>

                        c. Purpose of the account, the estimated account activity (including volume, balance ranges in the
                        case of current and deposit accounts; size in the case of investment and custody accounts), source

                        d. By-laws and any other relevant corporate documents filed with the Companies’ Registry;<br>

                        given by the directors in relation to the company and supported by a copy of the respective Board
                        Resolution;<br>
                        g. Copies of the list/register of directors and officers of the corporate entity including their

                        facility holder except in circumstances where the account is being operated by an intermediary for
                        the purpose of holding funds in his professional capacity;<br>
                        i. Satisfactory evidence of identity must be established for at least two directors, one of whom
                        should, if applicable, be an executive director where different from account signatories; and<br>
                        j. Such other official documentary and other information as is reasonably capable of establishing
                        the structural information of the corporate entity.<br>
                        <strong>C. KYC Documentation for partnerships and unincorporated business</strong><br>
                        i. The Company must obtain the following documents and information when seeking to verify the

                        a. Identification evidence for all partners/controllers of a firm or business, in line with the

                        Guidelines for individual customers. When authorized signatories change, care should be taken to

                        c. A copy of the partnership agreement (if any) or other agreement establishing the unincorporated

                        Partner in line with the requirements in these Guidelines for individual customers. The partners of
                        a partnership should be regularly monitored and verification carried out on any new partners whose
                        identities have come to light as a result of such monitoring or otherwise.<br>
                        iii. The following may also be required when the Company seeks to verify the identity of

                        f. The source of funds;<br>
                        g. A copy of the last available financial statements where appropriate;<br>
                        h. Written confirmation that all credits to the account are and will be beneficially owned by the
                        facility holder except in circumstances where the account is being operated by an intermediary for
                        the purpose of holding funds in his professional capacity; and
                        i. Such documentary or other evidence as is reasonably capable of establishing the identity of the
                        partners or beneficial owners.<br>
                        <strong>D. KYC Documentation for other legal structures and fiduciary arrangements</strong><br>
                        i. Legal structures such as trusts and foundations and nominee and fiduciary accounts can be used by
                        criminals who wish to mask the origin of funds derived from crime if the trustee or fiduciary does
                        not carry out adequate procedures. Particular care is needed on the part of the Company when the
                        facility holder is a trustee or fiduciary who is not an exempted client or an eligible introducer.
                        The principal means of preventing money laundering and terrorist financing through the use of legal
                        structures, nominee companies and fiduciaries is to verify the identity of the provider of funds,
                        such as the settlor and also those who have the power to remove the trustees/advisors. The settlor
                        may also be a sole trustee of the trust, in which case, identification documentation should be
                        obtained in relation to him.<br>
                        <strong>E. KYC Documentation for trust clients</strong><br>
                        i. The Company should take reasonable measures to obtain information about the true identity of the
                        persons on whose behalf an account is opened or a transaction is conducted. This applies especially
                        if there are any doubts as to whether or not these clients or customers are acting on their own
                        behalf.<br>
                        ii. At a minimum, the Company should obtain the following, whether the Company is a named trustee or
                        is providing services to a trust: –<br>
                        a. Name of trust;<br>
                        b. Nature/type of trust;<br>
                        c. Country of establishment;<br>
                        d. Identity of the ultimate natural person providing the funds, if not the ultimate settlor.<br>
                        iii. Normally, in addition to obtaining identification evidence for the trustee(s) and any other
                        person who is signatory on the account:<br>
                        a. Make appropriate enquiry as to the purpose of the legal structure and the source of funds;<br>
                        b. Obtain identification evidence for the settlor, protector(s)/controller(s) and for such other
                        person(s) exercising effective control over the trust which includes an individual who has the power
                        (whether exercisable alone, jointly with another person or with the consent of another person)
                        to:<br>
                        i. Dispose of, advance, lend, invest, pay or apply trust property;<br>
                        ii. Vary the trust;<br>
                        iii. Add or remove a person as a beneficiary or to or from a class of beneficiaries;<br>
                        iv. Appoint or remove trustees;<br>
                        v. Direct, withhold consent to or veto the exercise of a power such as is mentioned in (a) – (d)
                        above.<br>
                        c. In the case of a nominee relationship, obtain identification evidence for the beneficial
                        owner(s).<br>
                        <strong>F. KYC Documentation for foundations</strong><br>
                        iv. A foundation is an entity which exists to support a charitable institution and which is funded
                        by an endowment or donations. This type of non-profit organization may either donate funds and
                        support to other organizations or provide the sole source of funding for their own charitable
                        activities.<br>
                        v. It will normally be necessary to obtain the following documented information concerning
                        foundations:<br>
                        a. The foundation’s charter;<br>
                        b. The Registrar General’s certificate of registration or document of equivalent standing in a
                        foreign jurisdiction should be obtained in order to confirm the existence and legal standing of the
                        foundation;<br>
                        c. The source of funds. A financial institution should obtain and document information on the source
                        of funding for the foundation. In cases where a person other than the founder provides funds for the
                        foundation, a financial institution should verify the identity of that third party providing the
                        funds for the foundation and/or for whom a founder may be acting in accordance with verification of
                        identity procedures for natural persons; and<br>
                        d. A financial institution should obtain identification evidence for the founder(s) and for such
                        officers and council members of a foundation as may be signatories for the account(s) of the
                        foundation. A financial institution should follow the guidance provided when verifying the
                        identities of signatories. Where the founder is a company, a financial institution should have
                        regard to the guidance on corporate clients. Where the founder is an individual, a financial
                        institution should follow the guidance provided for natural persons.<br>
                        <strong>G. KYC Documentation for Executorship Accounts</strong><br>
                        vi. Where a business relationship is entered into for the purpose of winding up the estate it should
                        be verified in line with this guidance, depending on the nature of the executor (i.e. whether
                        personal, corporate, or a firm of attorneys). However, the identity of the executor or administrator
                        need not normally be verified when payment from an established bank account in the deceased’s name
                        is being made to the executor or administrator in accordance with the Grant of Probate or Letters of
                        Administration solely for the purpose of winding up the estate. Payments to the underlying
                        beneficiaries on the instructions of the executor or administrator may be made in accordance with
                        the identification and verification requirements as set out in the section on Identification
                        Procedures in these Guidelines.<br>
                        vii. If any suspicions are aroused about the nature or origin of assets comprising an estate that is
                        being wound up, then a report of the suspicions should be made to the Financial Intelligence
                        Unit.<br>
                        <strong>Certification of Customer Information</strong><br>
                        viii. The Company should exercise due caution when considering certified documents, especially where
                        such documents originate from a country perceived to represent a high risk, or from unregulated
                        entities in any jurisdiction. Where certified copy documents are accepted, it is the Company’s
                        responsibility to satisfy itself that the certifier is appropriate. In all cases, a financial
                        institution should also ensure that the customer’s signature on the identification document matches
                        the signature on the application form, mandate, or other document. ix. For natural persons,
                        face-to-face customers must, where possible, show the Company’s staff original documents bearing a
                        photograph and copies should be taken immediately, retained and certified by a senior staff
                        member.<br>
                        x. Where it is impractical or impossible to obtain sight of original documents, a copy is acceptable
                        where it has been certified by a suitable certifier as being a true copy of the original document
                        and that the photo is a true likeness of the facility holder.<br>
                        xi. A certifier must be a qualified practicing notary public or attorney-at-law.<br>
                        xii. The certifier should sign the copy document (printing his name clearly underneath) and clearly
                        indicate his position or capacity on it together with a contact address, telephone and facsimile
                        number and where applicable, a license/registration number.<br>
                        <strong>Customers’ Profile Policy</strong><br>
                        i. A customer profile policy is determined and implemented under particular criteria related with
                        clients risk profile. In particular the factors that specify the risk category at which a client is
                        attributed are mainly dealing with client:<br>
                        a. The nature of the customer’s business (whether cash intensive e.g. casinos and restaurants);<br>
                        b. The nature and frequency of the activity;<br>
                        c. The complexity, volume and pattern of transactions;<br>
                        d. Type, status and value of account;<br>
                        e. Type of customer, based on specific risk factors (e.g. whether ownership of a corporate customer
                        is highly complex for no apparent reason, whether the customer is a PEP, whether the customer’s
                        employment income supports account activity, whether customer is known to other members of the
                        financial group, whether delegated authority such as power of attorney is in place);<br>
                        f. Type of product/service (e.g. whether private banking, one-off transaction, mortgage);<br>
                        g. Delivery channels (e.g. whether internet banking, wire transfers to third parties, remote cash
                        withdrawals);<br>
                        h. Geographical origin of the customer;<br>
                        i. Geographical area (e.g. whether business is conducted in or through jurisdictions with high
                        levels of drug trafficking, corruption or lacking proper standards in the prevention of money
                        laundering/financing of terrorism, whether the customer is subject to regulatory or public
                        disclosure requirements);<br>
                        j. Whether the origin of wealth and/or source of funds can be easily verified and whether the audit
                        trail has been deliberately broken and/or unnecessarily layered;<br>
                        k. Unwillingness of the customer to cooperate with the financial institution’s customer due
                        diligence process for no apparent reason;<br>
                        l. Any other information that raises suspicion of the customer’s connection to money laundering or
                        terrorist financing.<br>
                        <strong>Risk based approach</strong><br>

                        i. The Company’s risk-based approach requires an assessment of the risk posed by the nature of the
                        business and the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures, while maintaining an overall
                        effective programme. This should be evidenced by categorization of the customer base, products and
                        services by risk rating and identification of assigned actions by risk types. <br>
                        ii. Prior to establishing a business relationship, the Company should assess the potential risk
                        inherent in each new client relationship. This assessment should take into account the products or
                        facilities to be used by the customer and whether and to what extent a customer may expose the
                        Company to risk. The financial institution should then decide whether or not to establish or
                        continue with a relationship. <br>
                        iii. The Company categorises customers in terms of risk in 3 groups, namely: <br>
                        a. Low Risk <br>
                        b. Medium Risk <br>
                        c. High Risk <br>
                        iv. The Company’s risk based approach take into account customer acceptance and on-going monitoring
                        policies and procedures that assist the Company in identifying the types of customers that are
                        likely to pose higher than average money laundering and terrorist financing risk. <br>
                        v. The Company is required to risk rate all client relationships including those in existence prior
                        to the implementation of these Guidelines. All risk ratings should be documented and should be in
                        place for all customers. <br>
                        vi. The Company adopted reasonable criteria for assessing the risks (e.g. whether ownership of a
                        corporate customer is highly complex for no apparent reason, whether the customer is a PEP, whether
                        the customer’s employment income supports account activity, whether customer is known to other
                        members of the financial group, whether delegated authority such as power of attorney is in place).
                        <br>
                        vii. The Company conducts periodic reviews (however, not more than two years apart) to determine
                        whether any adjustment should be made to its risk rating. The review of the risk rating for high
                        risk customers may be undertaken more frequently than for other customers and a determination should
                        be made by senior management as to whether the relationship should be continued. All decisions
                        regarding high risk relationships and the basis for these decisions should be documented.

                <strong>
                    A. Simplified customer due diligence
                </strong><br>

                i. Reduced due diligence is acceptable for example, where information on the identity of the customer or
                beneficial owner is publicly available or where checks and controls exist elsewhere in national systems.<br>

                <strong>
                    B. Enhanced customer due diligence
                </strong><br>
                i. A more extensive customer due diligence process should be adopted for higher risk customers. In
                particular, the Company applies enhanced due diligence to customers where the risk of being used for money
                laundering or terrorist financing is high. It follows, then, that simplified customer due diligence measures
                are not acceptable whenever there is suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing or specific higher
                risk scenarios apply.<br>
                ii. The Company may determine that a customer is high risk because of the customer’s business activity,
                ownership structure, nationality, residence status, anticipated or actual volume and types of transactions.
                A financial institution may be wary of doing business with persons from countries where, for example, it is
                believed that there is a high level of drug trafficking or corruption and greater care may be needed in
                establishing and maintaining the relationship or accepting documentation from such countries.<br>
                iii. Applying a risk-based approach, enhanced due diligence for high risk accounts may include, where deemed
                relevant, and with more frequency than applied for low risk customers:<br>
                a. An evaluation of the principals;<br>
                b. A review of current financial statements;<br>
                c. Verification of the source of funds;<br>
                d. Verification of source of wealth;<br>
                e. The conduct of reference checks;<br>
                f. Checks of electronic databases; and<br>
                g. Periodic reporting to the Board about high risk accounts.<br>
                iv. The Company should give particular attention to the following business relations and transactions:<br>
                a. Where a customer has not been physically present for identification purposes;<br>
                b. Correspondent relationships;<br>
                c. Business relationships or occasional transactions with a PEP;<br>
                d. Business relations and transactions with persons from or in countries and jurisdictions known to have
                inadequate AML measures;<br>
                e. Corporate customers able to issue bearer shares or bearer instruments.<br>
                v. In particular, the Company defines the following types of customers as high risk clients and therefore
                enhanced due diligence are applied:<br>
                a. Non-Profit Organizations<br>
                b. Non-Face to Face Customers<br>
                c. Introduced Business<br>
                d. Professional Service Providers<br>
                e. Politically Exposed Persons<br>
                f. High-Risk Countries<br>
                g. Bearer Shares<br>
                h. Correspondent Banking<br>
                <strong>
